/*You are given a tree of N nodes represented as a set of N-1 pairs of nodes (parent node, child node), each in the range (0..N-1).

Write a program to read the tree and find:
    the root node
    all leaf nodes
    all middle nodes
    the longest path in the tree
    (*) all paths in the tree with given sum `S` of their nodes
    (*) all subtrees with given sum `S` of their nodes
